Smartthings-Limit-Temp
======================

SmartApp to limit the thermostats Max and Min Settings.

First, thanks to statusbits' Pollster.  I used it as a framework for this app.  Pollster was laid out in a way that helped me understand the flow.

I wrote this quick little App to provide a max/min setting to the Smartthings connected thermostat.  Seems members of my family are under the impression that if you set the temperature really high (or low), the house will warm up or cool down faster. ;)
This provides me an automated way to limit that max/min temperature.
